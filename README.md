# ozu-gui

Ozu Gui is a desktop app which aims to improve the experience of creating beatmaps in osu! 
It's planned to have many advantages over the default editor, such as:
- better edition systems for hitobjects, hitsounds, colors;
- improved edition system for accelerated streams, contour sliders, bezier curves in general, etc.;
- precise control over slider velocity and beatmap bpm progression;
- real-time map verification and visualization;
- ability to switch effortlesly between maps of the same set to improve workflow;
- transfering beatmap data easily across difficulties of the same set, such as hitsounds and colors;
- and much more.
